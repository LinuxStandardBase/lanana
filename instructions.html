    <h2>LSB Registry Application Instructions</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Namespace management requests and actions are tracked in a public bugtracker.
  To apply for a new reservation, or request a change to an existing one over
  which you have control, please file a new bug at: <a href=
  "https://lsbbugs.linuxfoundation.org/">https://lsbbugs.linuxfoundation.org/</a>,
  using Product: LANANA and Component: "/opt/ namespace assignment". Note you
  will need to create a bugzilla account here if you don't already have one.
  </p>
  <p>When applying for a name in LSB namespaces for Init Scripts,
  Cron Scripts, Package Names or Provider Names, please
  perform the following steps for faster action on a submission:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Check LANANA's web pages to see if the name you wish to
    reserve is still available.</li>
    <li>Check if there is a pending registration listed in the bugtracker.</li>
    <li>Include the following information in your request:
      <ul>
        <li>Your name</li>
        <li>An Email contact address</li>
        <li>Name of the Entity (company, organization, etc.) you
        represent</li>
        <li>Name of the Application or Project needing a reserved
        name.</li>
        <li>Project Website (if there is one).</li>
        <li>Suggested reserved names and from which namespace
        (init|cron|package|provider) desired.</li>
        <li>Any other notes that would help processing the application.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is preferred if the email address is a persistent name, humans
        do leave the organizations they represent and the current LANANA
        data already have quite a few non-working contact emails. Thus, the
        style <i>lanana-admin@example.com</i>, set to deliver to the person
        submitting the request or other current contact, but able to be 
        changed later without contacting LANANA, is a good idea.  </li>
    <li>For the case of reserving init script namespace(s),
        please include a description of each init script's purpose.
        Example:
            <pre>
foobar - start/stop the foobard daemon
            </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Please try to anticipate what might be ambiguous to the registry
        team, and use the notes to explain.  The team will ask for more
        information in the bugreport if needed, but it's quicker if there
        doesn't have to be a lot of back-and-forth.</li>
  </ul>

  <p> The team will try and respond to your
  request in a timely fashion. If nothing seems to be happening,
  a ping can go to the <a href=
  "http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lsb-discuss/">LSB mailing list</a>,
  though comments/questions in the bug report will certainly be seen.</p>
