<H2>LSB Registry Application Instructions</H2>

<p>We prefer to track all namespace management 
actions publicly.  Please set up an account and 
file a new bug at: <a href="https://lsbbugs.linuxfoundation.org/" 
	target="_blank">https://lsbbugs.linuxfoundation.org/</a>
, under Product: LANANA and 
Component: "/opt/ namespace assignment" </p>
<p[>Please DO NOT use the former tracker at:
	<a href="https://bugs linuxfoundation org/?HISTORICAL%20ONLY" 
	target="_blank">https://bugs linuxfoundation org/?HISTORICAL%20ONLY</a>
which is used for research purposes, but NOT for LANANA matters as of 
mid-2013.  We intentionally publish a broken link above to prevent its
inadvertent use </p>

<p>
When applying for a name in LSB namespaces for Init Scripts,
Cron Scripts, Package Names or Provider Names, please 
<!-- follow these
guidelines or your application may be <strike>ignored </strike> delayed: 
 --> perform the following steps for a faster action on a submission:
<ol>
<li><b>Check LANANA's web pages to see if the name you wish to reserve is still available.</b>
<li><!-- Send an email to lsb @ lanana.org 
 -->
It speeds the review process when the bug filing also contains the 
following information:
<ul>
<li>Your Name
<li>Your Email Address
<li>Name of the Entity (company, organization, etc.) you represent
<li>Name of the Application or Project needing a reserved name.
<li>Project Website (if there is one).
<li>Suggested reserved names and from which namespace (init|cron|package|provider) desired.
<li>For the case of reserving init script namespace(s), please include a description of each init script's purpose. Example:
<pre>
foobar - start/stop the foobard daemon
</pre>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>Some of this is suggested by the email account used to file a bug, but,
there are obvious ways that exceptions may occur.  Please help and remove 
ambiguity.  We will try and respond to your request in a timely fashion.  
If there is a
need for intervention, please send such a request to the <a 
href="http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lsb-discuss/" 
target="_blank">LSB mailing list
</a>, or consult the last monthly email at that archive for alternative points
of contact. </p>
